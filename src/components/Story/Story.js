                                e knew that we couldn't keep subdividing Earth's
                                resource pie; we need to make the pie bigger if
                                we want to survive. The promise of resources
                                from the Moons, other planets, asteroids, and
                                the Sun made space hope for him to save our
                                future. The world population is likely to double
                                within 40 years and re-double shortly after
                                that; world resources will not, instead they
                                will run out. In space, solar power is infinite
                                (reducing the need to use forests and oil and
                                coal merely for fuel and eliminating the
                                pollution they cause), as are asteroid metals.
                                He believed that these unlimited resources would
                                enable us to reduce the plundering of our planet
                                and were the only way he could save the
                                existence of his kind. But to obtain these
                                resources, he required large structures in space
                                and needed rockets to get there. He believed in
                                his abilities and learned how to build the
                                infrastructure to obtain those resources. His
                                mission is creating alternative habitats for his
                                kind, and he knew such a mission demands massive
                                resources and a lot of sacrifices by the
                                workforce. That is just a bit of the big picture
                                showing how he wanted to impact the lives of
                                everyone around him.

                                e was nervous, scared even to go on the
                                expedition after finally finding a way to travel
                                to space in search of a new homeland. It took
                                him decades to finally create a way that ensured
                                his safe landing and survival, but he knew that
                                were so many unknown variables, and anything
                                could happen at any time. He sat there in his
                                seat, listening to the rumbling sound of the
                                engine as it warmed up and the countdown
                                installed in the ship started. "First turtle,"
                                he thought, "I will be the first turtle in
                                space. Those thoughts plagued his senses and
                                told him that he was finally going out to space
                                and all those years of hard work were finally
                                paying off. He proved nothing is impossible, and
                                turtles can achieve everything if they put their
                                whole heart and soul into it.

                                urtlеѕ move ѕlоwly bесаuѕе their lifestyle and
                                environment doesn't require them to be fast.
                                Thеу’rе hеrbіvоrеѕ, thеу dоn't hаvе tо сhаѕе
                                thеіr fооd. They have nісе, thісk ѕhеllѕ, whісh
                                mеаnѕ thаt mоѕt рrеdаtоrѕ ѕіmрlу don't bоthеr
                                thеm. Similarly, human beings aren't under
                                threat of another species on planet earth, and
                                the Earth's resources have always been
                                substantial to meet all our needs. However, over
                                the years, the resource consumption rate has
                                risen exponentially, and space exploration has
                                become necessary to ensure humanity's survival.
                                Turtles are slow but precise in their movement,
                                and when they set an objective, no matter what
                                or how far it may be, it becomes their holy
                                grail. In complex matters like space
                                exploration, the progress of human beings has
                                been slow, steady, full of obstacles and
                                failures. Still, we never gave up, and our
                                perseverance and commitment to the cause have
                                made it possible for us to make commercial space
                                flight possible, maybe in the next 10-20 years.
                                The end goal of traveling into space, like
                                discovering the New World, is to work and live
                                there, not only to sit back on Earth and think
                                about what autonomous spacecraft report back. We
                                don't deploy cameras to the Grand Canyon;
                                instead, we go there directly. America expanded
                                by sowing seeds in many hotspots and filling the
                                gaps with commerce, industries, and innovative
                                thinking.

                                he engines erupted, and he was in the air. He
                                held his breath for the first few minutes
                                waiting for the noise to fade, it felt like
                                forever to him until the first part of the ship
                                detached, and then the second countdown began,
                                and he was out of the atmosphere in his
                                self-made rocket when the final piece detached.
                                The screen in front of him gave him the view of
                                everything his spacecraft passed. Keeping track
                                of time in space is useless, but he knew he was
                                in outer space as the third alarm went off. It
                                was almost tough to see anything when he looked
                                outside the screen, but he knew he was on the
                                right track. He traveled across multiple
                                galaxies exploring planets and conducting
                                experiments to determine if any of them was
                                habitable. After multiple failures, he finally
                                discovered a new planet, which had enough
                                resources to sustain life as we know it. With
                                his sheer will and determination, he fulfilled
                                his dreams of finding a new home in space, and
                                now he aims to set up a colony on this planet.

                                umanity has always discovered ways to thrive
                                under challenging circumstances, and we will do
                                so in space as well. We can't start living and
                                working in space unless we first get there. And
                                it is our purpose to leave the cradle of our
                                mother planet.
